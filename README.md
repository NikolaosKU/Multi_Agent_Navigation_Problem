# Multi_Agent_Navigation_Problem

Navigation and travelling problem to solve the Pac-Man maze optimally. The game involves multiple instances with justt one agent (Pac Man) ot more than two agents (Pac-Man and Ghosts)

In both cases, the scope is to use popular supervised and unsupervised algorithms in order to:

pac-man agent stays alive as much time as possible before gets 'eaten' by the ghosts
pac-man agent tries to eat as many fruits (rewards) as possible before gets eaten
pac-man agent shoots for the minimim disctance between current position and fruit based on 'manhatan distance' or 'euclideian distance'
Pac-man gets rational using heuristics
Popular algorithms that were used for the game are:

CSP (constraint satisfacation problems)
Decison trees
Local search
Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
SAT solvers
A* algorithm
..
The code was implemented soleldy using Java and Python. The code present here is a small part of the total problem.

The code is not my propoerty. Part of the code was provided by the team of the course FAI of KUL computer science department.
